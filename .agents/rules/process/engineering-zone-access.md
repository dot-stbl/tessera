# Engineering-zone access — harness tiers

The engineering zone (`.agents/rules/...`-canonical list below) is **not**
uniformly off-limits. Access depends on **which harness** is running and
**whether the owner is in the loop**.

## The two tiers

| Tier | Harness | Owner in loop? | Can edit engineering zone? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A — interactive** | **pi-coding agent** (this harness) — owner present in the session, authorising turn-by-turn | ✅ yes | ✅ **yes, when the owner authorises in-session** (verbally, via a picker answer, or by an active phase D-ZONE override) |
| **B — batch / unattended** | Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, CI runners, detached subagents without live owner | ❌ no | ❌ **no** — requires **separately obtained written permission** (a prior chat record, an ADR, a CODEOWNERS note) per change. Session presence alone is not authorisation |

## What "engineering zone" means (the frozen core)

- `src/shared/Tessera.Shared.*/**` (kernel contracts, cross-cutting libs)
- `src/host/Tessera.Host/**/Program.cs` (composition root)
- `src/host/Tessera.Build.Tools/**` (MSBuild SDK / targets)
- `Directory.Build.props` · `Directory.Build.targets` · `Directory.Packages.props`
- `.editorconfig` (production) — see `coding/analyzers.md` owner-approval rule
- `tessera.slnx` · CI workflows · `CODEOWNERS`
- `.agents/rules/**` · `.agents/STATE.md` · `AGENTS.md` (the rules themselves)

## Authorisation model

### Tier A — pi-coding (interactive)

The owner is in the session. Authorisation is **in-session** and may be:

1. **Explicit per-change** — owner says "yes, change X". Covers the change only.
2. **Phase D-ZONE override** — owner authorises a whole phase's engineering-zone
   touches up front (e.g. "Phase 1 D-ZONE: Directory.Build.props + new shared
   project"). Covers every task in that phase's PLAN. Logged in
   `.agents/STATE.md` decisions + the phase `CONTEXT.md`.
3. **Standing, for this repo** — none. There is no blanket "pi-coding can always
   edit engineering zone". Each non-trivial change still wants a sentence of
   owner intent on the record.

When authorised, the agent **edits directly** — it does not produce a patch for
the owner to apply, does not stop to re-ask if authorisation was already given
in this session, and does not treat the zone as forbidden by reflex. The owner
being present and saying "do it" **is** the permission.

After editing, the agent still respects:
- the build gate (`dotnet build tessera.slnx -c Debug` → 0/0) —
  `process/build-verification.md`
- the self-audit gate — `process/worker-audit.md`
- `.editorconfig` owner-approval for severity changes — `coding/analyzers.md`

### Tier B — batch / other harnesses (Claude Code etc.)

The owner is **not** in the loop turn-by-turn. Engineering-zone edits require
**separately obtained written permission**: a prior chat record, an ADR, a
`CODEOWNERS` note, or a phase D-ZONE override documented **outside** the current
batch run. "I think the owner would want this" is not permission.

If a Tier-B agent hits an engineering-zone file without prior written
authorisation, it **stops** and reports — exactly the legacy "STOP and ask the
user" posture.

## Why two tiers

The engineering zone is frozen for **batch** agents because they can't ask
questions and a wrong edit propagates before anyone sees it. An **interactive**
pi-coding session has the owner on the other side of every turn — the owner can
catch a bad edit immediately, so the cost of allowing direct edits is low and
the cost of forcing a stop-and-ask round-trip on every engineering-zone touch
(which this repo does a lot of — composition root, build tools, kernel) is high.

The build gate + arch tests + self-audit gate remain the safety net regardless
of tier: a bad engineering-zone edit fails the build before it ships.

## Good / Bad

```
# ✅ Tier A (pi-coding, owner present)
owner: "почини TEMP DIAGNOSTICS блок в targets"
agent: edits src/host/Tessera.Build.Tools/Tessera.Build.Tools.targets directly,
       runs build gate, commits with [.stbl](feat/build-tools): ...

# ✅ Tier A — phase D-ZONE override already on the record
agent (executing Phase 1 Task 4): rewrites src/host/Tessera.Host/Program.cs
       per the PLAN; does not re-ask — D-ZONE override in 01-CONTEXT.md covers it

# ❌ Tier A — no authorisation yet
agent: about to edit src/shared/Tessera.Shared.Kernel/** on its own initiative
       → STOP, surface the proposed change, get a "yes" first

# ❌ Tier B (Claude Code batch)
agent: edits src/shared/Tessera.Shared.Kernel/** because "it looks like the fix"
       → violation; should have stopped and reported for separately-obtained
         written permission

# ❌ Tier A — treating zone as reflexively forbidden after authorisation
owner: "давай без агентов, правь Program.cs тут"
agent: "это engineering zone, STOP and ask"
       → wrong; owner already authorised in-session, edit directly
```
